1)Create in CMOS logic with a pull-up network and a pull-down netwrok and in layout and schematic, the function F = (A · (B + C + D))'
Connect the output with C and do transient analysis:
i) For the values c=1f F, 20f F και 50f F
ii) Run DC analysis when the output of the circuit only depends on fron the value of the input B
